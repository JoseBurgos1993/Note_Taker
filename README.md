# Note_Taker
For this assignment, I was tasked with creating the backend for a Note Taker app that runs on Heroku. I used express and fs to get requests from the user and read/write data to and from a json file. The user is able to create new notes with a title and save them, delete them, or view them.

The github repository is [here](https://github.com/JoseBurgos1993/Note_Taker). The deployed page can be located [here](https://tranquil-bastion-05461.herokuapp.com/).

## Usage
At the mainpage, click on the Get Started button. From there you may type in a title and description. Once something is written in both fields, a button will appear at the top right allowing you to save. Saved notes appear on the left side where they may be clicked to view their contents, or deleted by clicking the red trash button.
